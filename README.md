## Usability
![App](/screenshots/app.png)
In the red box you can see the panel of all various audio strips,  
and in the blue one there's the control panel to control them all.  
#### Let's dive in.  

![Strip](/screenshots/strip.png)
In each strip you can control the relevant track
![Control-Audio](/screenshots/control-audio.png)
In the control audio section of it you can play or pause a track simultaneously,  
mute it or make it loop forever, or until you change it.
![Control-Song](/screenshots/control-song.png)
Here you can control what will be the beginning and the end time of each track,  
change current time that is being played (or will be), and see the current time aswell  
![Control-Cards](/screenshots/control-cards.png)
In this section you can control when the track will be played on the   
general timeline of the application. i.e. making a mix.
In the yellow box you can see the entire timeline, while the white  
boxes (indicated by blue box) are each 5 seconds. When pressed, the card  
will be active and when reached by the cursor it will fire play function.  
In the red box you can see said cursor, indicating current time of the entire application.  
(When reached 60, which is the end of the cards, it will return automaticall to the beginning of the timeline)

Lastly, we have the Control Panel
![Control-Panel](/screenshots/control-panel.png)
In here you can control the entire strips panel, pressing play will play all tracks with  
your adjusted configurations, whether if its loop, mute and also starting and ending times.  
You can set the entire app to mute or loop through it and also a shortcut for changing all  
of the strips's ending time.
